Hello! I'm Srikanth, a current M.S. in Robotics student at Northwestern University. I am most interested in the field of mobile robotics, and I hope to use my skills and experience to develop interesting and impactful robots. I bring coding experience in ROS2, Python, C++, and C, as well as industry experience working in the field deploying robots. My most recent project involves a Hangman player using a 7-DOF robot arm. 
<!-- Hi there! I'm Hang, a graduate student at Northwestern University pursuing a Master of Science in Robotics degree with a focus on machine learning, computer vision, and control systems. I have a solid foundation in programming languages including Python, C++, C, and JavaScript, and am proficient in frameworks like ROS2 and PyTorch. I also have experience with embedded systems and have implemented algorithms for robotics projects such as quad-rotor control and mobile manipulation. My recent projects involve implementing Feature-based SLAM on a TurtleBot, ChatGPT-powered Robot Chef, and Edge-conditioned GCN for Sentiment Analysis. I am actively seeking full-time opportunities in the field of robotics and am excited to explore challenging projects that leverage my skills and interests. -->

## FIRST Robotics

### Team 5823 ACE
In 2015, I had the privilege of founding Team 5823, a high school robotics team that, to my delight, expanded to include over 50 enthusiastic members during my tenure as captain from 2015 to 2018. Our journey was full of learning experiences, with one of the highlights being an unexpected feature on Chinese national television. To our astonishment, we emerged victorious in the International Division of the 2015 China Robotics Challenge. Encouraged by this accomplishment, we continued to participate and were honored with a win in the National Division in 2016.

### Team 7529 Mulan
In 2018, I had the unique opportunity to co-found Team Mulan, the first all-girl robotics team in mainland China. As one of the mentors from 2018 to 2019, it was deeply rewarding to witness the team grow, attracting over 50 dedicated members. The journey wasn't without its challenges, but with concerted efforts, we managed to secure over 30,000 USD in sponsorships to support our endeavors. The creation of Team Mulan was driven not by a desire for accolades, but by a vision to encourage more girls in China to explore the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and Robotics. At that time, these fields were largely dominated by male participants in China, and we believed in the importance of challenging this status quo. It's been an honor to play a part in inspiring and empowering these young women to pursue their interests and make their marks in the robotics arena.

### Team 7594 Nautilus
In 2019, seeing a need for more engineering exposure at my high school, I founded Team Nautilus, a robotics team with the mission of introducing younger students to the exciting world of engineering. Having the opportunity to mentor Team Nautilus from 2019 to 2020 was an immensely gratifying experience. It was a joy to share my passion for this field and to see these young individuals develop an interest of their own. Our efforts bore fruit beyond cultivating an interest in engineering among the students: our team was honored with the Highest Rookie Seed Award and the Rookie Inspiration Award at the Finger Lakes Regional. However, the real reward lay in seeing the sparks of curiosity ignite in the students, and knowing we had given them a valuable introduction to a field that had inspired me so deeply.

## My Robotics Story

### Getting Started
I first experienced robotics in grade school creating combat robots using the LEGO Mindstorm NXT system. I enjoyed the blend of hardware and software challenges that pushed me to be more creative in my approach. Soon after, I participated in Carnegie Mellon's "Andrew's Leap" summer program making robots using Arduino boards. During this program, I made laser tag blasters, maze solving robots, and a system that identified firefly species by the flash pattern. This exposure to using real code and real hardware to solve problems, sparked an ongoing interest in the field.

### Professional Experience
Post graduation, I began working at Gather AI, a robotics startup committed to solving the data needs of logistics companies through drone-based inventory. 

## Leadership

### Rowing
For 9 years, I competed in the sport of rowing, and had the privilege to compete at the high school, collegiate, and club levels of racing. These years taught me lessons in consistency, grit, and time management, all of which were prerequisites for the medals earned. During my time competing, I was granted the honor of Team Captain both in high school and college for my commitment to the team and efforts to lead by example. I also was chosen to be my college team's Equipment Manager due to my organizational skills and technical understanding of repairs, purchasing, and care for the equipment in our fleet. 

### Coaching
Apart from strict competition, I also had the opportunity to take up coaching for 6 years at the high school at collegiate level. Teaching and sharing knowledge is a passion of mine, and having the ability to shape young athletes into fierce competitors has been a real treat. At the high school level, I have been able guide students to recruitment at colleges of their choice. At the collegiate level, I have been able to push my athletes to compete on the national level against their fellow students. Seeing these athletes compete and win against their peers has brought me a lot of joy both from the impact I have been able to make as well as from the feelings I know we have shared during races. Igniting curiosity and a willingness to succeed is a trait I hope to bring to any team in which I participate, and while I focus solely on robotics, I am excited for those opportunities that lie ahead.
