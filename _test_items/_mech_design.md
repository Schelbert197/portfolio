## Project Overview
This page shows a quick summary of some of the work I am able to share from my experience in hardware engineering. This includes mechanical and electro-mechanical projects.

## On-board Computer Shelf

### Project Goal
I was tasked with creating a structure that would support computing equipment aboard commuter trains for a notable northeast U.S. transit system. The project gave me full control of the design (pending requestor approval) and had the following constraints:
- Size: Due to space limitations on the train.
- Material: For strength, manufacturability, and vendor agreements.
- Handedness: Not all trains are equivalent, so some adjustability for cable management was required.

This design incorporated aspects of Design for Manufacturability (DFM) as well as Design for Assembly (DFA). 

### Main Challenges
The computing eqiupment supported by this structure are both cumbersome and heavy meaning the structure would need to support the equipment's weight and inertia as the train moves throughout the trips. Also, since the structure is supporting computer equipment, the design needs to support the ability for the installer to manage the cables effectively. Lastly, this structure needs to be simple to manufacture to minimize costs and assembly time. 

For these reasons, I landed on a design made of painted steel sheet metal with bolted joints for certain cable ties and computing equipment for easy assembly and removal.
